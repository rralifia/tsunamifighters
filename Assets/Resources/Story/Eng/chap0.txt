Fury "All right, Captain! [setFace(Fury,1_anxious)] By the way, Azumi, have you heard the issue that a catastrophe might occur in Indonesia at the end of the year?" 2
Azumi "Yes, I've heard of it. Natural disaster issue, right? The issue was discussed by my friends in class." 1
Fury "Yes, major disaster caused by natural event. What do you think if a disaster really occurs?" 2
Azumi "The issue is uncertain. I think you shouldn't worry too much." 1
Fury "Aren't you afraid of your safety here?" 2
Azumi "Fury, it depends on your preparedness for the disaster. There are many disasters in Japan too." 1
Fury "Then, are you ready?" 2
Azumi "Perfectly prepared. In fact, what kind of disaster did the issue say?" 1
Fury "Earthquake. If an earthquake occurs near the coast, it might be followed by a tsunami." 2
Azumi "The time when an earthquake will occur cannot be predicted. Apart from earthquakes, tsunamis may also occur if landslides occur on the seabed or objects fall into the sea." 1
Fury "Yes, you are right. If a volcano erupts in the sea, it can also cause a tsunami. What should we prepare for being safe?" 2c
