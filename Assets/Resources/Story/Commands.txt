Commands for Visual Novel.
Every click event is a separate line in the file. The events below show how to call actions to make the chapter work.
Each line may have multiple actions. Actions on the same line should be delimited by a space. Because of this, no value,
including filenames, should contain spaces.

#DIALOGUE COMMANDS
#Make a character speak
  characterName "dialogue"                                                      ex: Raelin "Hi, how are you?"
  + symbol makes dialogue additive to continue from last segment.               ex: Raelin +"That's good to hear."
  No name before dialogue means use last speaker.                               ex: +"That's good to hear."

  #USING DIALOGUE COMMAND TAGS
  commands inside of dialogue can be used to trigger and segment the dialogue into different parts. So instead of having multiple lines for one character,
  everything can be put on one line.
  {c} wait for input and clear
  {a} wait for input and append
  {w n} wait for n seconds and clear
  {wa n} wait for n seconds and append                                          ex: INSTEAD OF USING
                                                                                Raelin "Hi!"
                                                                                "How are you?"
                                                                                +" Good!"

                                                                                USE THIS

                                                                                Raelin "Hi!{w}How are you?{a} Good!"

  #USING CHOICES AS EVENTS
  Every choice should be on its own line. A choice is not a regular event so it is not paired with dialogue.
  a choice begins with the word 'choice' to signify it is a choice and not a normal line.
  after choice have the choice title in quotes.
  then inside of squiggly brackets we have our choices in quotes followed by a single command to be executed if that choice is made.
                                                                                ex: choice "How are you doing?"
                                                                                    {
                                                                                      "Fine"
                                                                                        Raelin "That is good to hear."
                                                                                      "Terrible"
                                                                                        Raelin "Oh? Why is that?"
                                                                                    }

  #USING EVENTS INSIDE OF dialogue
  events are contained inside of brackets []. They control things that happen while dialogue is being displayed.
  Actions can be called withing brackets as they would normally be called at the end of a line. Separate actions by a space character.
                                                                                ex: "Hello [showScene(true,blur)]everyone!"
  then there are events that control different things aside from regular actions.
  [txtSpd speed,charactersPerFrame] - change text architect speed               ex: "Let's move [txtSpd 15,2]slowly."
  [/txtSpd] - return architet to normal speed.                                  ex: "Move [txtSpd 30,1]slow [/txtSpd]but then return to normal speed."
