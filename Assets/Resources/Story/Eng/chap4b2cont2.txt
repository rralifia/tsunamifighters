Azumi "We must be vigilant, afraid of aftershocks if the earthquake is strong. What caused the earthquake just now, huh?" 1
Fury "Hmm ... the earthquake is due to the shifting of the plates, not because of volcanic activity because this area is far from the volcano. Take a shower before everyone gathers. No more than 10 minutes, deal?" 2

Fury "Around 16:00, Mom." 2
Ibu as [mom_eng] "And when does the activity begin...?" 1
Fury "It will start at 5 o'clock. By the way, how is Uncle Tama?" 2
Ibu as [mom_eng] "He's good now. He just has to take a good rest. You should prepare. It's already 16:45. If anything happens, call me. Then I'll hang up the phone. Bye bye." 1
